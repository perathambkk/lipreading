# Lipreading

A reporitory for lipreading on the [lipreading in the wild (LRW) dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/lip_reading/lrw1.html) using the SpotFast Networks (ICONIP 2020). 
The SpotFast Networks utilize temporal window, two input pathways with lateral connections and two memory-augmented transformers to recognize word-level lip movements. The test accuracy is 84.4%. For comparisons with other methods, please consider [PapersWithCode](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/lipreading-on-lip-reading-in-the-wild).
